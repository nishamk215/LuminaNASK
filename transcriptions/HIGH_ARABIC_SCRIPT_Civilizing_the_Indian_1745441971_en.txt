Good night we study the Indian Industrial Carlisle School and its role in addressing what is known as the Indian problem and with the expansion of the United States against indigenous peoples and its tradition aimed at leading General Richard Henry to transform indigenous youths through their reproductive facilities and U.S. values. By accepting and learning the English language, American and Christian history, the school is placed under strict routine procedures in the military to replace structural and productive taxes that are trained children on trade, agriculture and borders while girls learn domestic skills to integrate into American families. They believe that this education saves indigenous children from their lives and often replaces them with the principles of faith. The mission of Carli believes that America has the right and duty to citizenship. By rehabilitating indigenous youths, the school aims at eliminating cultural opposition and preparing them for life in a fast-paced society. The leader of indigenous communities finds that the school provides heritage but advocates ignore these fears and consider the tradition of indigenous peoples as an beginning and a barrier to progress. To support the future, the blood of the indigenous population is completely and often for the sake of the American values. They view Carlisle not only as a school but as a decisive tool to ensure the national unity and the elimination of predispositions. While some feel the loss of traditional traditions are due to Carlisle's factors that this is a necessary change for both students and the nation. Producers of most countries on the ground, thank you for joining us.
