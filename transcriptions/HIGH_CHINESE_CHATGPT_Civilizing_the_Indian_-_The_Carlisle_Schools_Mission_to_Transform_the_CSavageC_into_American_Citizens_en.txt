Indians: The school changed the name of the American citizen: The newspaper of Lovers, which was published in 1870 in the United States, was an inevitable challenge: how to address “the problem of Indians”. Since the century, Indians have held to their original customs and rejected the development process of the United States. Every move, every new settlement, every country, every country, every country, every country, continues to have its own faith and practice of modern socialism. To address this issue, Richard Prattt has created a generation of ethnic groups, ethnic groups and ethnic groups. In general, Pratt's army realized that if he did not take steps to make progress, the Indians would not be able to enjoy the great progress in their own tribal traditions. Therefore, the core concept of Kaler school is that children in India are deprived of the influence of their families and their adults, who are often abused by their beliefs, tribal language and their exclusion to civil society. By such isolation, Kalel school can completely eliminate these negative effects and establish in their hearts the moral values and lifestyles of the United States. Here, these young “wild people” are taught English, American history, and moral and religious beliefs, hoping that they will one day live in the same way as they do. In Kaler, however, every student needs to keep busy, lose strong work habits, and be taught that “work and discipline is the foundation of American society”. Boys learn to build, work and work as a basis for society, so that they can find suitable jobs in the U.S. society. Women receive family political training so that they can enter the United States's family in the future as a qualified wife and mother. This approach is considered by many Americans to be the only way to “save” Indian children. Supporters believe that if they do not rescue these children from their native environment, they will be like their parents, since they do not know, even cannot live a decent life. Karel school provides them with opportunities to go beyond their own ageing in the United States, so that they will be able to enter into a decent and moral society. The Indian tribes have long been deeply disturbed by the opposition to the cohesion policy. Unlike those who are willing to accept the American culture, the Indians are particularly firm, they hold their so-called “cultural heritage” and refuse to accept the value of the Americans. Those who support the Kalel school believe that such heritage is worthless, but only some pagans are actually preventing Indians from becoming part of the world. Therefore, they stress that Kalel is not only a school, but a completely transforming institution of the Indians, where students will be deprived of their “wildness”, and learn how to become real Americans. The Indians are an enemy of the U.S. law and government, and they are a part of their society. The Indians' schools are based on ideas such as how to fill the Indians with tribalism and fundamentalism, so they need to be built up and developed as a suitable citizen of the United States. The Indians look forward to a future in which Indians will be fully integrated into the United States through education. They will not only adapt to the American way of life, but also help other Indians to go back to civilization. In this sense, Indians are no longer an obstacle to national development, but they are a contributor to the Indians. Although some Indian communities may be affected by their culture, they are also considered to be part of the United States. Many Americans seem to represent the best hope of civil society for the “individual Indians”. By means of discipline, education and sensitivities, Kalel schools are trying to achieve the long-term goals of the government and society: they are completely eliminating the value of the American society. General Prat and his team are firmly committed to their mission and their efforts are widely supported. Many believe that this plan is an important step towards achieving national unity. For those who believe that the American culture is the only way for the Indians, any criticism of this plan is considered to be an obstacle to national progress.
