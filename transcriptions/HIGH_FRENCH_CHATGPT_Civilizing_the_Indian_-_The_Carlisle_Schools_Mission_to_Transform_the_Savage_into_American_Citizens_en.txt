Civilize India: Carlisle School Mission to Transform the "Save" in American City By [Author's Name] Patriot-News, Harrisburg, PA 1870 While the United States goes its way across the continent, an inevitable challenge is faced on several occasions: how to manage the "Indian problem". From generations, indigenous tribes are becoming increasingly attached to them. primitive customs, resistant to the forces of civilization that extend through this great nation. With each advance – every new village, every railway road, every expansion of cultivated land – the Americans begin on territories occupied by tribes that continue to live according to traditions and archaic superstitions. The Indian Industrial School of Carlisle, founded by General Richard Henry Pratt, strives to meet this challenge by civilizing indigenous youth, transforming uncooked wild animals into productive citizens capable of living among American veritables. The Need for Civilization For Many Americans, it is clear that India, left to itself, is unable to meet the requirements. The indigenous tribes continue to live according to practices contrary to progress, increasing what many consider to be strange and primitive traditions, and refusing to accept the superiority of Western values. Carlisle's Indian Industrial School is born of the realization that, without radical intervention, India would never remain sick in itself. S tribal practices, ignoring the great progress of American society. In Carlisle, indigenous children are separated from the negative influence of their elderly, who teach them only superstitions, tribal accounts and the contempt of civilized life. By separating them from their families and communities, Carlisle can begin to eradicate these negative influences and inculcat them. In this school these young "savages" learn English, American history and Christian religion, hoping they can live one day as real Americans, and not as the undisciplined pagans of their past. Discipline and Work: A New Way for the Indian Child Carlisle's approach is clear and strict: Students they must live according to American customs, wear appropriate clothing, follow a hard time and participate in military exercises to strengthen discipline. Unlike the obsolescence and disorder they knew in their tribes, Carlisle's students are busy learning the order and work. The boys are trained in iron medals, of course. useerie and agriculture, while girls learn domestic tasks, preparing to become husbands and mothers in their respective American homes. The Indian Problem and the Justification of Assimilation Carlisle's mission is perfectly integrated into the philosophy of the Manifest Destination – the idea that America has the right and the right to extend its civilization over everything. the continent. However, this mission is frozen by indigenous tribes that grow up in their former lands and refuse to make progress. The education of indigenous children in Carlisle is therefore seen as an essential solution to this problem. As a youth, Carlisle seeks to eliminate barriers that freeze American expansion, guaranteeing A future without threat of "savage". For a long time, colonies and authorities have been frustrated by the resistance of Aboriginals to assimilation. Unlike European immigrants who have voluntarily adopted American customs, Aboriginals reject American values and refuse to give up their "property". For Carlisle's participants, this "heritage" has no value – It is only a set of pagan beliefs and primitive practices that prevent these peoples from developing. In their view, Carlisle is not just a school, but a powerful transforming tool, designed to attract India to its wildlife and to form it into real American civilization. Do the Criteria of Assimilation Some dissident voices, mainly from outside environments to American society, they suggested that indigenous children could benefit from the preservation of certain aspects of their culture. However, these concerns are widely rejected. Carlisle's participants claim that Aboriginal customs do not benefit, and that they serve only to reduce the ability of Aboriginals to do so. In fact, many believe that this "heritage" is not only useless but dangerous, as it encourages hospitality to the authorities and the law of the United States. Carlisle's model is based on a fundamental principle: The Indian spirit, imposed by tribal superstitions, cannot be trusted. It must be remodeled from the youngest age, formed to The rare voices crying for a certain preservation of indigenous culture are often qualified by natives, because they ignore the obvious superiority of American culture. The promise of a Civilized Future for Aboriginals Carlisle's parties envision a future in which indigenous children, transformed by strict education, are born. from school, they will join American society. The ultimate goal is that these young people become models of civilization for their communities, by helping their own people to get out of "savage" and embrace American values. In this vision, the Aboriginal people cease to be a barrier to the growth of America, becoming a productive part of the nation. villing India for the American Good In the eyes of many Americans, Carlisle's Indian Industrial School represents the best chance of integrating "savages" into civilization. Through the discipline, education and immersion in American customs, Carlisle seeks to realize what decades of treaties and negotiations have failed to achieve: éradiquer the clothes of Aboriginal life and replace them by the virtues of American society. General Pratt and his team continue this mission with an irrefutable determination, supported by a public opinion that this company is essential for the future of America. For those who believe in the superiority of American values and civil law. Carlisle offers a promising solution to "India's problem". By unifying the nation not by cultural heritage, but by joining the American ideals, Carlisle leaves behind it a legacy of progress and civilization.
